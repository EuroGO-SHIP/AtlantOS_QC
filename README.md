# AtlantOS QC (GLODAP QC1 tool) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/549480947.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10015794)

This software is an interactive tool for helping in first Quality Control (1st QC, QC1) of Hydrographic Cruise Data. Fully open source code built mainly in Python but using Node, JavaScript, HTML5 and related technologies. It can be run on most Unix, Windows and MacOS systems.

## About

The development of this tool was initially funded by [**H2020-AtlantOS**](https://www.atlantos-h2020.eu/) project for _Optimising and Enhancing the Integrated
Atlantic Ocean Observing Systems_, being this funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 633211.

Version 1.0 was released under [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2603122.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2603122) as Deliverable _**D2.6 GO-SHIP Software and Manuals**: Software packages and best practice manuals and knowledge transfer for sustained quality control of hydrographic sections in the Atlantic_ of [**H2020-AtlantOS**](https://www.atlantos-h2020.eu/) [Work package 2.1](https://www.atlantos-h2020.eu/project-information/work-packages/wp2/task-2-1/), being a Global Ocean Ship-Based Hydrographic Investigations Programme ([GO-SHIP](https://www.go-ship.org/)) task for support the quality assurance of on-going surveys and perform Quality Control (QC) procedures

Since version 1.0 to 1.4.0, the application had no specific nor continuous funding for its development, having received partial support from [H2020-COMFORT](https://comfort.w.uib.no/) project and being also a contribution to WATER:iOS Interdisciplinary Thematic Platform [@WATER_IOS_CSIC](https://twitter.com/water_ios_csic)

From 1.5.0 onwards is supported by [**Euro GO-SHIP**](https://eurogo-ship.eu/) (Grant #101094690), a EU-HORIZON project for _Developing a research infraestructure concept to support european hydrography_

Since v1.6.0 having Octave installed is no longer a recomendation, as internal Octave code was translated to python. Full app functionality can be provided alone with the provided installers

Version v1.7.0 fully removed Octave engine

## Installation

It's not essential for this software to run, but in order to take advantage of the main functionalities of this software program it is absolutly recommended to have [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) installed, as most parameter calculations relies on Octave/Matlab code. Installers can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html)

### Manual Installation

1. Download and install base dependencies:
    1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) >=3.11. Recommended downloader and instructions: [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

    2. Download and install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Follow instructions from: https://yarnpkg.com/ (Alternatively you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)). The recommemded version for this proyect is "berry". The last one used was the version 4.9.4. To update it:

            npm install -g yarn
            sudo corepack enable             # I had to this once, other time I didn't need to do it
            yarn set version latest          # or "berry" instead of "latest"

    3. Newer versions of Yarn (2.x and above) don't create a node_modules folder by default. Instead, they store dependencies in a global cache (like in the `AppData` folder). However, this can cause issues with native modules, which often expect the traditional `node_modules` folder.

        To fix this for your project, you need to go back to the old behavior of using a node_modules folder. To do that:

        1. Create a file called `.yarnrc.yml` in the root of your project.
        2. Add the following line to that file: `nodeLinker: node-modules`

2. Download this project

3. Install the python `atlantos_qc` package and its dependencies in your python setup (if you have installed python through miniconda/anaconda and is not in PATH, you have to use Anaconda Prompt as command shell):

        python -m pip install git+https://github.com/ocean-data-qc/tilecloud.git
        python -m pip install --editable .
            or :
        python -m pip install .

4. Install the node dependencies in the `atlantos_qc_js` folder

        yarn --cwd atlantos_qc_js/ install

5. Open the GUI from the `atlantos_qc_js` folder

        yarn --cwd atlantos_qc_js/ start
        (first launching time delays a bit, please wait)

## Libraries and languages Used

* [**Python**](https://www.python.org/). Python version 3 is the main language in the application. Most processing on data and files are performed through Pandas and/or NumPy libraries in python, and sent to Bokeh, which is also built on python and has an own javascript library for displaying and interacting. Python source code is presented in atlantos_qc folder in the application.

* [**Bokeh**](https://bokeh.pydata.org) (Python Library). Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh is the main library for the application, as deals with graphic presentation and interaction (Bokeh Development Team (2014). Python library for interactive visualization. [http://www.bokeh.pydata.org](http://www.bokeh.pydata.org))

* [**Electron**](https://electronjs.org/) (formerly known as Atom Shell). Electron is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromium and Node.js into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux. The application uses Electron to embed in an application the bokeh plots and drive the user interaction with interface, providing also all the menus and interfaces.

* [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript). Electron is built on node, that is built with JavaScript. All code for menus, screens, and interacting elements on the application are made with Javascript. Some of the functionality are provided directly by Electron and some other by Bokeh, but the code to merge all these things were built with JavaScript. JavaScript source code is presented in atlantos_qc_js folder in the application.
